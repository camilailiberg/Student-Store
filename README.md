Submitted by: **Camila iligaray**

Deployed Application (optional): [Student Store Deployed Site](ADD_LINK_HERE)

### Application Features

#### CORE FEATURES

- [x] The API should contain an endpoint that serves an array of all products in the store
- [x] A Store model should handle all data management logic for the API and be the interface for read/write operations to the JSON file.
- [x] The frontend should include a landing page that displays the products available for purchase.
- [x] Each product should have an individual page that shows the details of the product.

#### STRETCH FEATURES

- [ ] Deploy your website with Heroku & Surge.
- [x] An endpoint should exist for creating orders and saving them to a JSON file. Each order should contain the email of the person placing the order, the items associated with the order, and the quantity of each item purchased.
- [x] There should be a `Sidebar` component that appears on every page and has two states - `open` and `closed`.
- [ ] When the sidebar is opened, it should display a shopping cart of all the products the user currently has in their cart.
- [ ] It should also calculate and display the total amount in dollars for the checked-out items.
- [x] When it's closed, the sidebar should be much thinner and not display its internal content.
- [ ] A checkout form should be available that allows the user to enter their email and send their order to the API.
- [x] Create an endpoint for fetching all orders in the database, and an endpoint for serving an individual order based on its id.
- [x] Create an endpoint that serves only a single product based on the product's id
- [ ] Build a page in the UI that displays the list of all past orders and lets the user click on any individual order to take them to a more detailed page of the transaction.
- [ ] Allow users to use an input to filter orders by the email of the person who placed the order.

### Reflection

- Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

Yes, the topics discussed in the labs prepared me to do the assignment, specially lasts lab videos.

Once the core requirement were reduced I felt confident to complete all the core features.

- If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.

If I had had more time I would have worked more on the looks of the website and dedicate more time to the CSS.

I also would have added the form, shopping cart functionality and add-to-shopping-cart buttons, and I would have also added the feature for seeing orders and filtering them.

- Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

What went well is the fact that I was able to do all core features and also implement an extra feature that I created which was to add categories in the navbar so that the user could browse by category. I also was able to implement a few of the extra features that had to do with the backend, which I was really happy about because it helped me understand backend better.

There was nothing that didn't go as planned.

I liked Robet's styling of his website and that he added an about me page, which I though was a great idea and I would have added it if I had more time.

### Shout out

Shout out to Robert and Ashani for making Friday fun!

Also shout out to Sharon and Gevork for caring so much about us as a group when we were placed togheter!

In addition, shout out to all the TAs for the lectures and help.

A special shout out to Matt for doing the extra lecture! It really helped me understand React A LOT better, and I probably would have struggle a lot more doing the assignment if I Matt wouldn't have done that extra lecture, so thank you! Also shout out to Matt for being a great CodePath Mentor!
